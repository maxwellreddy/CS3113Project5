# CS3113Project5
This is my Project 5 work for CS 3113

Instructions:

Run main.cpp to run the game.

Press Enter to start the game. 

Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move the playable character Arle (The girl with orange hair and blue and white clothes) left and right. Press the Z key to jump and the X key to shoot a fireball. Only three fireballs can be present on the screen at a time.

You have three lives. If an enemy touches you or if you fall into a hole, you lose a life. If you lose three lives, the game is over. Your goal is to reach the star border on the right side of the level. Each time you reach the border, you move onto the next level. You win the game if you complete all three levels.
